# RobotArmModel

The purpose of this repository is to store the mathematical model of a Robotic Arm.  This is a simplified model of the arm, does not contain the effect of the friction force and some other effects. However the equations are still complicated. The robot has three rotationa joints. 

Soon I will put a user manual here, to make it easily available for anyone
